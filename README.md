## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnB data from 2016 to better understand:

1. what is the most popular home type?
2. where is the most popular location?
3. when to rent to maximize the revenue?
4. when is the off-peak season for maintenance?
5. how to achieve a good rating?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The data is inside the folder: ./AirBnB_Seattle

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@dyushu/become-a-landlord-in-seattle-b0a688b5199).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
